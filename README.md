Machine Learning solutions for various regressions problems

## Machine Learning models
<li>Scalable Robust Gaussian Process</li>
A robust to outliers Gaussian Process derived from an infinite Mixture of Gaussian distributions who is scalable in the number of training points.
The model uses a distributed approached based on the Generalised Product of robust-GP experts to aleviate the computational memory and time effort.

<li>Heteroscedastic GP</li>
A Gaussian process derived from an observation model whose noise is sampled from a Gaussian distribution with an input dependent variance.

<li>Generalised Product of Gaussian Process Experts</li>
A distributed approach based on the weighted sum of GP expert predictions. Each expert is trained with a reduced number of training points to aleviate the standard GP computational memory and time effort.

## Case Studies

<li>Glass Manufacture</li>
Digitalisation of the melting process in a float glass manufacture production line. Estimate the relantionship between the furnace parameters and fault density using Machine Learning techniques to forecast product quality and aid operation decisions.

<li>Signal Processing</li>
Robust Gaussian process regression for estimating the Nitrogen Dioxide concentration from low-cost sensor signals using open-source data from the Breathe London project website (low-cost sensors) and the London Air Quality Network (reference sensors).
